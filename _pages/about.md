I always loved taking pictures using my mobile camera and I enjoyed it every time having a more professional camera in my hands. Lately I finally convinced myself to buy an own DSLR and after some time I decided to get a Sony Alpha 58 (I know that is not a very professional model, but it wasn't too pricy). On top of that I decided, that I wanted to share some of my shots with everyone else. To have full control over all of my data I created this blog as a platform to show my pictures to the world.

I thank you for visiting this webpage and I hope you are enjoying my photos. If you have any suggestions to improve the design of this webpage or my photographical skills, feel free to [contact me](mailto:{{ site.data.about.frank.contact.photo.email }}).
