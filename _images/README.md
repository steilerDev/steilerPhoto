This folder structure contains the original versions of each published picture. 

## Organization
They are organized in folders, matching the filename of the associated blog post (without extension).

## Picture naming convention
In general, the filename corresponds to the shown image name on the webpage. However underscores ('_') are replaced by whitespaces and the first 3 characters are ommited (this is, in order to sort the pictures using '00-', '01-', ...).

The alphabetically first image will be used to create the preview picture, and their order on the blog is determined by their alphabetical order.
