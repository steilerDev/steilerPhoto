The San Francisco area is obviously technology focused, leading to a lot of brand new, super fancy modern cars. I am sure that there is no place where you can see more Teslas during a single day than the Silicon Valley.

On the other hand a beautiful oldtimer is as popullar as a brand new car. I was able to spot some of these rare occurences.
