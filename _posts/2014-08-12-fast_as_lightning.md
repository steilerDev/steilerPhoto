We went sailing at the Shoreline lake some time ago. Fortunately the Ferrari Club America - Pazific Region had their annual picnic on the same day at the same location, so I was able to photograph some of the most expensive cars in the world. I hope I didn't mess up my chance to get some beautiful pictures.
