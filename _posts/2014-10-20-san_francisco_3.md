Allright guys, it has been some time since my last post, but I am back with new and old material. First of all , I am finishing my series of pictures taken in San Francisco during the summer.

I did not take this pictures at a single place, but during my tours through the city. So you are not going to find a common theme in these shots, but an aggregation of great photos.

San Francisco itself has a special feeling after its business hours. Walking through Chinatown at that time of the day creates its own feeling. Everyone is cleaning their shops and preparing for the evening and the evening sun is creating its own atmosphere!

I just love that city!
