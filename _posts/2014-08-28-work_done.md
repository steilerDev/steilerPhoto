After having some stressful weeks, finishing work on both sides, private and professional, I official present the revised steilerPhoto web blog!

<!--more-->

My friend [Tammo](http://github.com/tammon/) and me achieved some great [progress](https://github.com/steilerDev/steilerPhoto/network) on improving the experience of this web blog. I hope you guys like our work. Feel free to drop us some feedback, using the new designed social media links in the navigation bar.

On top of that I should be able to catch up with the photos I took the last couple of weeks and release them soon, because I had some incredible trips seeing some beautiful places...be prepared.

The attached photo was a snapshot taken during one of my late night working sessions at some time this week, so don't expect a super high quality picture here.
