Hello everyone, despite the fact that I haven't posted in ages (even though I promised not to do so within the last entry) I finally found the time to work through the rest of the pictures of last summer. I hope to catch up with my shots and give them to you.

About this set of pictures: At the end of the summer I hadn't seen one of the most famous landmarks of the bay: The Golden Gate Bridge. Concluding I visited a friend in San Francisco and we spend a whole day getting to the bridge and walking up and down. I had a great time and took some interesting pictures.

It was my last free weekend in the States and I really enjoyed it. I miss the area and people, but I will eventually return this summer and I am looking forward to that.
