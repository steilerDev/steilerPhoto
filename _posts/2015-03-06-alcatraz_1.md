I really care about this set of pictures. We visited the former prison island Alcatraz and I tried to capture its dirty beauty.

The feeling you get when walking around this place is a very strange one, considering its history. I highly recommend this place to everyone who  has the possibilities to visit it. Unfortunately we only got the daylight tour (which is actually not too bad since I was able to shoot some pretty awesome pictures in my opinion), but I heard that the night tour is even better. So be early (and I mean a month in advance early at least) and get your tickets.
