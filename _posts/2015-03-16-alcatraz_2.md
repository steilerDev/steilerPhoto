Another set of pictures from Alcatraz. This time I chose to focus my pictures around the things you can see from the island.

I think I found the citation from the title on one of the signs during my tour on the island and to be honest it was the thing that kept me thinking for quite some time. I am pretty sure that the view was one of the hardest punishments for the inmates. Having sights like the Golden Gate Bridge and the skyline of San Francisco always in view, but not beeing able to go there must have been hard to wrap your head around.

Fortunately I was able to leave the island and therefore bring you these pictures. Enjoy!
